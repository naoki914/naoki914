- 👋 Hi, I’m @naoki914, Currently working as a backend developer in a B2B cloudstorage company.
- 👀 For BE development I mainly use python, and recently I've been experimenting with Dart (Flutter)

- 🌱 I’m quite interested in security and cloud tech in general. (Currently preping up for my AWS SAA exam) 
- 💞️ Hit me up if you think it would be interesting to collaborate on something
